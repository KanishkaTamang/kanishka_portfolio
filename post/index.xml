      <description>Executive Summary   Since the beginning of humanity, we have been living in groups. These groups eventually grew into what we today call societies. Even with diversities among society all across the world, few things are always common. Crimes committed by a few of the members in the society play a negative but impactful role in the well-being of everyone in that society. In spite of the law enforcement deployed, crime still remains a big threat.</description>

      <description>Executive Summary Down Syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder which is mainly due to extra genetic material from chromosome 21 therefore the people with Down syndrome have 47 chromosomes. The symptoms of Down syndrome include poor judgement, short attention span and cognitive impairment (CPL, 2020). In order to evaluate the effects of the drug to diagnose the DS the protein expression mice dataset was published. The report aims to analyse the effects of the protein which could be an important factor to have an overall effect on the recovering ability to learn amongst the mice with down syndrome.</description>

      <description>Executive Summary Family Planning refers to the ability of a couple to give birth to the desired number of children and to have the best age gap (preferably 24 months) between the first and second child (WHO,2020). Primarily, family planning helps to reduce the need for an abortion of a child and sometimes the death of a mother. Due to the revolution of medical science, there is now a low death rate and with the increase in unplanned children, there would be a spike in the global population further having a derogative effect on the economy.</description>
